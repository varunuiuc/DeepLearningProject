# Data download instruction:
GAMENet is tested on real-world clinical dataset MIMIC-III.
Demo data set can be accessed to public.
https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii-demo/1.4/
Data can be downloaded as 

Real world dataset (MIMIC-III v1.4) on same physionet site can be accessed based on credential access.
With valid/approved credentials data can be downloaded as csv or can be accessed on AWS or GCP.

* download MIMIC data and put DIAGNOSES_ICD.csv, PRESCRIPTIONS.csv, PROCEDURES_ICD.csv in ./data/
* download DDI data and put it in ./data/
